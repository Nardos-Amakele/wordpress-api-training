# API Training Integration

This project integrates a WordPress plugin with a Flask backend API to perform sentiment analysis from an input text from the user.
Users input their text in a form in WordPress. This is then sent to the flask server.
The sentiment of the text (positive or negative) along with a confidence score is returned and displayed to the user.
